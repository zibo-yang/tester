      <description>In CryptoKitties, users collect and breed oh-so-adorable creatures that we call CryptoKitties! Each kitty has a unique genome that defines its appearance and traits. Players can breed their kitties to create new furry friends and unlock rare cattributes.
CryptoKitties is one of the world’s first blockchain games. ‘Blockchain’ is the technology that makes things like Bitcoin possible. While CryptoKitties isn’t a digital currency, it does offer the same security: each CryptoKitty is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by you.</description>

      <description>The Cryptopunks are one of the earliest examples of a &amp;ldquo;Non-Fungible Token&amp;rdquo; on Ethereum. The CryptoPunks are 10,000 uniquely generated characters. No two are exactly alike, and each one of them can be officially owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain. Originally, they could be claimed for free by anybody with an Ethereum wallet, but all 10,000 were quickly claimed. Now they must be purchased from someone via the marketplace that&amp;rsquo;s also embedded in the blockchain.</description>
